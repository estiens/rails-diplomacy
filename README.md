# rails-diplomacy

This project aims to build a Diplomacy website based on Ruby and Rails.

## Planned features

For brevity, only the ones our vile competitors lack.

* Fully interactive point-and-click web interface (with text fallback for grumpy old grognards)
* Live (but also persistent) communication between arbitrary combinations of powers
* Startup phase with detailed options on power choice (random, preference list, appointed etc.)

## Stay tuned!

B. Kruijswijk (yes, I do nested parentheses (no, I never learned LISP))).
